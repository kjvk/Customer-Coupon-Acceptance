# Customer-Coupon-Acceptance

* The goal of the project is to find "if the customer accepts the coupon or not". The observation while doing the analysis are present in the below notebook.

         [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/kjvk/Customer-Coupon-Acceptance/blob/main/prompt.ipynb)

* There are certain columns like below, which doesn't have proper description/information or data. Also they are not required for the current targeted analysis, hence removed.
  
         * car
  
         * toCoupon_GEQ5min
  
         * toCoupon_GEQ15min
  
         * toCoupon_GEQ25mi columns

* Below are the columns which have missing values, the missing values were replaced with the Mode imputation mechanishm. This mechanism will replace the missing values with the more frequent 
  occuring data.
  
         * Car
  
         * Bar
  
         * CoffeeHouse
  
         * CarryAway
  
         * RestaurantLessThan20
  
         * Restaurant20To50
  
*  Acceptance of coupons by passengers

*  In almost all cases drivers have accepted coupons to Carry-out, Coffe House and Cheap reaturants. Out of which cheap-restaurants coupons are accepted most in every passenger sector.

*  Acceptance of coupons by drivers when they are alone. As stated above the Carry-out, Coffe House and Cheap reaturants coupons acceptance rate is more than the rest.

*  Acceptance of Bar coupons is minimal when drivers are with kids. Interestng factor is bar coupon acceptance rate is way smaller even with friends as passengers.

* Conclusion : Drivers have reacted differently in each scenario and hence cannot dtermine the exactly if the drivers have accpedted the coupon or not and also the driver data when they are travelling alone is more than any other variety.My recommendation is to gather more data with other varieties as well to avoid bias and get accurate prediction.
